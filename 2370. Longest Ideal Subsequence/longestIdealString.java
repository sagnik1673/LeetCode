// You are given a string s consisting of lowercase letters and an integer k. We call a string t ideal if the following conditions are satisfied:
//    t is a subsequence of the string s.
//    The absolute difference in the alphabet order of every two adjacent letters in t is less than or equal to k.
// Return the length of the longest ideal string.
// A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
// Note that the alphabet order is not cyclic. For example, the absolute difference in the alphabet order of 'a' and 'z' is 25, not 1.

// Example 1:
// Input: s = "acfgbd", k = 2
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The longest ideal string is "acbd". The length of this string is 4, so 4 is returned.
// Note that "acfgbd" is not ideal because 'c' and 'f' have a difference of 3 in alphabet order.

// Example 2:
// Input: s = "abcd", k = 3
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The longest ideal string is "abcd". The length of this string is 4, so 4 is returned.

// Constraints:
//    1 <= s.length <= 10^5
//    0 <= k <= 25
//    s consists of lowercase English letters.
